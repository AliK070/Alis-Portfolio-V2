      summary: 'Choosing the Right H-Bridge and why I Went with the TB6612FNG',

      <p>When I was working on an Arduino project that involved controlling two DC motors, I found myself hunting for an efficient and reliable H-bridge. After weighing a few options, I landed on the <strong>TB6612FNG</strong> and for good reason. 
      The TB6612FNG is a dual motor driver capable of delivering up to <strong>1.2A of continuous current per channel</strong>. What drew me to it was its balance of <strong>efficiency, functionality, and compatibility</strong>, especially when working within the current and voltage limits common in microcontroller-based projects.</p>

<p>What sets this H-bridge apart is its thoughtful feature set. Beyond the basics controlling motor speed and direction, it also supports active <strong>braking</strong> and <strong>motor stop</strong> functions. The operational voltage range (2.7V to 13.5V) makes it suitable for most small to mid-sized motors, and it comes equipped with <strong>overheat shut-off</strong> and <strong>undervoltage lockout</strong> for added safety. From a performance perspective, the TB6612FNG impresses with an efficiency rating of <strong>91–95%</strong>, which is considerably higher than many alternatives in its class. And being able to drive <strong>two motors simultaneously</strong> gives it a practical edge for compact, multi-motor designs.</p>

<p>Another huge plus is how <strong>user-friendly</strong> it is. The board layout is clean, with clearly labeled pins, making it approachable even for beginners. Hooking it up to an Arduino or similar microcontroller is relatively straightforward with just a few control pins and some PWM tweaking.</p>

<p>That said, it’s not without limitations. If your motors draw more than 1.2A continuously, the TB6612FNG won’t cut it. It can technically operate at voltages as low as 2.5V, but expect reduced performance at the lower end of that range. When stacked against a more common option like the <strong>L298N</strong>, the TB6612FNG clearly takes the lead in terms of efficiency, size, and modern features like a <strong>low-current standby mode</strong>. However, the L298N can <strong>handle higher current loads</strong> and operate at <strong>higher voltages</strong>, making it a better fit for power-hungry applications.</p>

<p>In the end, the choice really depends on your project’s needs. If you’re building a compact, battery-powered robot or something where efficiency and space matter, the TB6612FNG is a fantastic option. But if you’re working with beefier motors or higher voltage requirements, the L298N might still have a place in your toolbox.</p>
