# Ali's Portfolio V2

Ali's Portfolio V2 is a complete revamp of my original personal website, redesigned with a modern tech stack and improved user experience in mind. This version reflects my growth as a developer and showcases my skills, experiences, and projects in a sleek and responsive web application.

# The Stack I used:
- Frontend: Vite + React.js
- Styling: Advanced CSS
- Routing: React Router for client-side navigation
- Animations: CSS Keyframes
- Responsive Design: Mobile-first layout

# A modern layout and design:

For Ali's Portfolio V2, I adopted a clean, card based layout to present content in a visually appealing and organized format. This box-style design is a tribute to my original portfolio but with a far more polished and modern aesthetic.

The entire visual theme has been redesigned to reflect a professional yet personal style. I opted for a blue-accented color palette paired with material-inspired blacks and smoky whites, creating a sleek contrast that works well in both light and dark modes. The use of bold font weights and a contemporary sans-serif typeface enhances readability and gives each section a distinct presence.

Unlike my last portfolio, I focused more on the mobile layout and implemented quality of life changes to the navbar such as a hameburger menu as well as better scaling. 

Here is the color pallete I aimed for while redesigning my portfolio:
